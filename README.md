# Binary-search

This repository contains my solutions to binary search problems on 1D and 2D arrays.

## Importance of Binary Search

Binary search is a fundamental algorithm in computer science with significant importance for several reasons:

1. **Efficiency**: Binary search is highly efficient, especially for large datasets. It reduces the search space by half with each iteration, resulting in a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements. This contrasts with linear search, which has a time complexity of O(n) and becomes impractical for large datasets.

2. **Versatility**: Binary search can be applied to various data structures, not just arrays. It can be used with sorted lists, trees, and more. This versatility makes it a valuable tool in a wide range of algorithms and applications.

3. **Speed**: Due to its logarithmic time complexity, binary search is extremely fast. It's a go-to choice for searching in large databases, dictionaries, and other scenarios where speed is critical.

4. **Optimizations**: Binary search can be optimized and adapted to various situations. For example, you can implement binary search on rotated arrays, find the first or last occurrence of an element, or search in 2D arrays with minor modifications
